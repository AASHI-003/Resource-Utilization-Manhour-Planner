# Resource-Utilization-Manhour-Planner
Objective
The objective of the Resource Utilization & Manhour Planner is to optimize workforce efficiency and project delivery by accurately forecasting, allocating, and tracking manhours across tasks and resources. This tool ensures balanced workload distribution, prevents resource bottlenecks, and provides real-time visibility into utilization rates, enabling data-driven decisions for improved productivity and cost control.


Scope
The Resource Utilization & Manhour Planner covers the following areas:


Resource Allocation

Assign resources (employees, teams) to tasks/projects based on availability and skill set.
Define planned manhours for each resource per task.



Manhour Forecasting & Planning

Estimate manhours required for each activity or phase.
Compare planned vs. actual manhours to monitor efficiency.



Utilization Tracking

Track resource utilization percentage (e.g., actual hours vs. capacity).
Identify underutilized or overburdened resources.



Project-Level Monitoring

Aggregate manhour data across multiple projects.
Highlight variances and risks in resource planning.



Reporting & Visualization

Generate dashboards for utilization trends, workload distribution, and variance analysis.
Provide drill-down capability for resource-level details.



Integration & Accessibility

Enable online access via SharePoint, Power BI, or Teams.
Support automated data refresh and role-based access control.
